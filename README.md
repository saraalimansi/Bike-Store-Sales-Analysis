# Bike Store Sales Analysis in Europe

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze bike store sales data from different locations across Europe. By examining the data, the aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve decision-making processes in sales and marketing for bike stores.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Bike Store Sales in Europe](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sadiqshah/bike-store-sales-in-europe/data)
- **Description**: This dataset contains information on bike store sales, including details like product category, store location, sales volume, and time.
- **Data Features**:
  - Product details (e.g., model, category)
  - Sales data by month and year
  - Store information (e.g., region, country)

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Removed any missing or incomplete data entries.
   - Standardized data formats for consistent analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Sales Trend Analysis**: Analyzed monthly and yearly sales trends to identify peak sales periods.
   - **Category-Based Analysis**: Investigated the performance of different bike categories (e.g., mountain bikes, road bikes) to identify top-selling categories.
   - **Geographical Analysis**: Compared sales performance across different regions to identify high-performing stores or regions.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Used bar charts, line graphs and pie charts to visualize sales trends and category distributions.

## Key Findings
- Sales generally peak during the summer months, suggesting seasonality effects.
- Road bikes tend to have higher sales volumes compared to other categories, especially in urban areas.
- Certain regions consistently outperform others, highlighting potential areas for expansion or focused marketing.

## Future Work
- Additional analysis on factors influencing sales trends, such as promotions or holidays.
- Further segmentation of customer demographics if data becomes available.
